Assigment to create a home webpage using client persona.
Using your new knowledge of HTML and CSS you need to create a semantic structure with a header, main content and footer. Decided on flexbox for layout. 
The client’s logo needs to be in the header and the main content needs to have a large promotional banner and three columns with text and images below it. 
The footer should have two columns. The first column must contain a smaller version of the logo and the second column should have copywriting information. 
Styled to create the appropriate look and feel to capture the attention of the client’s target audience.
